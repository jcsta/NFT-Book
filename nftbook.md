## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Mintbase grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary):
A new NFT Book platform, aimed at writers and publishers who want to mint and sell their NFTs, as well as allow for online reading 

  
- A brief description of your project:
We launched 3 books in November, during the 69 Porto Alegre Book Fair (which has more than 1.5 million visitors) as NFTs, using different tools and platforms, to test them all. None of them pleased us 100%.
Today we have several interested authors and even a publisher (which owns several authors).
We want to have a platform that supports the Portuguese language (also Spanish and English), that can be easy to use and we also want to help with our knowledge in NFTs, how these authors can create their communities.
  
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem:
The platform is aimed at creating NFTs books - fully linked to Mintbase's objectives and it will be developed on the Near blockchain using BOS (Blockchain Operational System).

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project:
The idea was born from the need to launch books for 2 well-known authors.
Me, who own the education channel about NFTs - ViaNFT (https://beacons.ai/vianft.eth) and my partner who educates about crypto and has an interesting network of contacts, started this challenge in August.

After a quick search, we found only 1 platform launched on Polygon that could help us.
To test, I launched my ebook on how to get started in NFTs on this platform. It is not very easy to use, even for those who are used to web3.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
Let's use the best ideas already implemented and adjust our reality.
A platform that has an interesting UI that we can base ourselves on is: https://readl.co

- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality


- An overview of the technology stack to be used


- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed


- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
All the books were launched on different plataforms to test. Here you can see what we created:

- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
We are creating a niche platform for writers and authors to release their works as NFTs.
We will create an easy-to-use platform that serves both traditional book writers and current ebook creators
  
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
The target audience for the platform is writers and publishers who want to publish their books in NFT format.

- What need(s) does your project meet?
Authors, writers are creators, who, like designers and artists, no longer receive much of the benefits of their creations through their creative power.
We want to help them sell and distribute their content as NFTs and, above all, help them create their communities.
  
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
    Yes. As I mentioned above, there is a platform that we want to base ourselves on: https://readl.co

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

As mentioned above, we had a demand to launch books and so we looked for platforms that could do this. In Portuguese there is no specification for this.
Given the difficulty and because we only found one, but it is not easy to use, and knowing that we have many other authors wanting to launch their books, we want to combine our knowledge in Near, NFT and blockchain to launch our product.

Links can be accessed on the website we created for the books we released. Each book is on a platform. We were able to test and think about what could be improved.

-----------------x----------------------

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
